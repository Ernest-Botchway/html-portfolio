<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Ernest Botchway, a multifaceted creative with a passion for music, cybersecurity, and web development. By day, I'm a college student honing my skills in Cybersecurity. By night, I bring harmony to life with my piano and bass guitar. When I'm not jamming or studying, I build digital experiences as a web developer. I'm on a mission to share my knowledge and skills with others, empowering them to thrive in the digital world. Through workshops, mentorship, and online content, I aim to make a positive impact at the intersection of music, tech, and cybersecurity.
