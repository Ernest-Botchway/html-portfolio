      <h2 class="card-title">Bass guitar</h2>
      <p class="card-text">"Let's get groovin'! When teaching bass guitar, I focus on the fundamentals first - proper hand positioning, finger placement, and basic rhythms. Then, we dive into iconic basslines that make students go 'aha!' Think Billie Jean or Under Pressure. By combining theory with fun, popular songs, students stay motivated and develop a deep love for the instrument. It's all about feeling the music and having fun!"</p>

      <h2 class="card-title">Piano</h2>
      <p>"Tickling the ivories! When teaching piano, I love starting with simple yet powerful melodies that spark creativity. We explore dynamics, expression, and technique through timeless classics or popular modern pieces. By breaking down complex songs into manageable parts, students build confidence and master new skills. Whether it's Chopin's Nocturne or a favorite video game theme, the goal is to ignite passion and make music-making a joyful experience."</p>
